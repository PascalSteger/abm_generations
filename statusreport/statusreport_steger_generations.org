* Abstract
  I investigate the evolution and stability of an
  agent based model for opinions in a group of agents with a
  finite lifetime.

* Motivation
  The bounded confidence model describes the way an ensemble of agents
  converges on a common opinion, or several final opinions.
  Effects that cannot be described with this model is long-time change
  of opinions, as is e.g. seen in human societies over several
  generations.
  One way to mitigate this problem is by including said generations in the
  model. I implement this idea by adding one additional internal
  parameter for an agent, its age.
  I propose as hypothesis that as old agents disappear to be
  replaced by young, unbiased agents, a shift in the overall opinion
  will occur. I will determine what model parameters have the most
  influence and how the timescale for a considerable shift of opinion
  compares to the lifetime of single agents.
* Implementation
  I model agents $i\in[1,N]$ with two internal parameters: an opinion
  $o_i$ and an age $a_i$.
  I use several sets of initial conditions:
  
1. consensus: All agents have a common opinion $o_i=c\in[0,1]\,\forall
   i\in[1,N]$. The age is uniformly distributed. This setup enables us
   to determine the timescale after which a consensus is lost due to
   replacement of old agents with new agents having a uniform opinion
   distribution.
   
2. uniform field: The opinions are uniformly distributed, and so are the
   ages. This setup serves to determine the criteria for consensus
   finding.

I introduce a social distance $d$ between two agents encompassing
opinions $o_i$, physical positions $x_i$ (2D on a lattice, or 3
dimensional, or any appropriate social distance), age $a_i$. In each
timestep, two random agents meet. They interact based on two possible
rules:

1. if the distance between them is smaller than a parameter
   $\varepsilon$ with a strength parameter $\zeta$.

2. always, but the strength parameter is decreasing with increasing
   distance: $\zeta=\zeta_0/g$.

The interaction is based on the bounded confidence model

    $o_i(t+1) = o_i(t)+\zeta*(o_j(t)-o_i(t))$

    $o_j(t+1) = o_j(t)+\zeta*(o_i(t)-o_j(t))$
* Preliminary Result
For the uniform field, and $\zeta=0.5$ with the distance-dependent
interaction rule, I get the evolution shown in the figure. We can see the
initial convergence, and the appearance of new agents with time
(vertical lines mark births). A second "opinion peak" is forming at
timestep 800, with mostly young agents, but some old ones as well.

* Further Investigations
I will
- develop a metric to determine the number of concurrent stable opinions;
- plot the timescale between new opinions as a function of mean lifetime of
   the agents divided by the frequency of new births;
- run a simulation starting from a consesus and compare it with the
  analytic treatment, which showed that the first measurable
  deflection would occur after half the lifetime of the initial agents.
