Generations in Bounded Confidence Model
=======================================

How long does it take for an established opinion to change completely? -- About a lifetime. Find out below why that is so:

- generations_psteger.pdf explains the setup
- generations.py contains the code to reproduce the figures
- talk_generations.pdf contains slides for a talk on the subject

You will need python3, matplotlib, pdflatex, and possibly doxygen installed.

Have fun!
